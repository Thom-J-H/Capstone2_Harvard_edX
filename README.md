# Capstone2_Harvard_edX
In partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Harvard edX: Data Science Professional Certificate, this repository contains the following files:
* Capstone_Two_Report_Haslam_2019_03_12.Rmd
* Capstone_Two_Script.r
* Capstone_Two_Report_Haslam_2019_03_12.pdf
* Capstone_Two_Report_Haslam_2019_03_12.html

And the original [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) data set (WDBC)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)), available from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php), Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems, University of California, Irvine:
* wdbc.data.csv
* wdbc.names.txt
  
The script (and RMD) import the data set from the UCI source, so there is no need to download it first.

**Please note:** 

The RMD will take a minimum of 40 minutes -- and more likely over an hour -- to run.  It also requires that the user has installed a number of ML packages for R, consistent with those used in for [ensemble modelling in Harvard edX course](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/machine-learning-in-practice.html#ensembles) on Machine Learning.  The script largely runs silently (the output captured).  Any warnings or error messages may be safely ignored.  Not every model works perfectly on each testing condition/variation, which is the point of testing the various models against similar controlled conditions.

Thank you,<br />
